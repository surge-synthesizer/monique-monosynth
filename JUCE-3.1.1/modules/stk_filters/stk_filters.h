  The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio
  signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the
  C++ programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid
  development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with
  an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control,
  ease of use, and educational example code.  STK currently runs
  with realtime support (audio and MIDI) on Linux, Macintosh OS X,
  and Windows computer platforms. Generic, non-realtime support has
  been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should
  work with any standard C++ compiler.
