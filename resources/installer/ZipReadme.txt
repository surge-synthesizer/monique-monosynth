Thank you for downloading the Monique nightly

Monique is undergoing active development right now and this zip file contains a build
from the head of code. As such it may have bugs, problems, missing features, or half
developed capabilities.

One of the capabilities we still haven't developed is cross platform installers. So
this zip file just contains the platform specific components and you have to hand install them.

On Windows, move the VST3 to your VST3 folder C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3 and move the
standalone exe wherever you want.

On Mac install the components in either global or local "Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components" and
"Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3"

On Linux install the vst3 in /usr/lib/vst3 or ~/.vst3 and the exe wherever you want.

Over the next month or two we will get proper platform installers. Thanks for your patience until then
